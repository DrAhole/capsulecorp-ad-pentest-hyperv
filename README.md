# 1. Capsulecorp Pentest

The Capsulecorp Pentest is a small virtual network managed by Vagrant and Ansible. It contains five virtual machines, including one Linux attacking system running Xubuntu and 4 Windows 2019 servers configured with various vulnerable services. This project can be used to learn network penetration testing as a stand-alone environment but is ultimatly designed to complement my book [The Art of Network Penetration Testing](https://bit.ly/38N9S9e).



## Why is this cool?
Setting up a virtual network to learn penetration testing can be tedious as well as time/resource consuming. Everything in the capsulecorp environment is pretty much done for you already. Once you get Vagrant, Ansible and VirtualBox installed on your machine you only need to run a couple of `vagrant` commands to have a fully functioning Active Directory domain that you can use for hacking/learning/pentesting etc.
